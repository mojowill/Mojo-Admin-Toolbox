A small toolbox of functions for customising the admin dashboard, useful for hiding stuff from clients!

== Description ==

The Mojo Admin Toolbox is a collection of little functions I found myself using a lot to customise the admin dashboard of Wordpress, specifically when I was hiding stuff from a client or customising it for them! The latest version (1.3+) REQUIRES WordPress 3.5+.

= Features =
* Remove/Hide the Wordpress Comments system, never confuse your client again!
* Easily customise the Login Page Logo.
* Set a New custom default avatar for your site.
* Remove dashboard widgets for ALL users.
* Hide the theme editor page and stop clients messing up the theme!
* Easily change the Dashboard footer text for your own.
* Change the Descriptions and link destination for your custom login logo.
* Hide the Wordpress meta generator tag, make it a little more difficult for those script kiddies!

= New Features =
* Modify From name and email address for all emails sent by your Wordpress site!
* Image uploader now in use on the options page (Now using the WordPress 3.5 Media Manager)!
* Added option to override theme, useful if your theme is trying to do the same thing as this plugin is!

= Future Development Plan =
* Option to set 'superadmin' who can see everything
* Option to hide other Wordpress features (Links, Tools, Plugins etc)
* Option to hide Update notices from non-superadmins
